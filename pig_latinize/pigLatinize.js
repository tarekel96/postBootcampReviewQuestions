// The Question

/* 
Write a function that translates a text to Pig Latin.

In case you've never heard of this silly language, 
to translate a word from English to Pig Latin, 
you move the first letter to the end of the word, and then ad _ay_. 
So, "fish" in Pig Latin is "ish-f-ay".

```
pig_latinize("fish"); // ishfay
pig_latinize("your car is very nice"); // ouryay arcay siay eryvay icenay
